                <p>This summer I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Eric Rawdon
                through the Center for Applied Mathematics Research Program.
                The purpose of the research was to study the structures of knots
                and links using two-dimensional grid projections.

                <p>In my CISC 230 class last fall, my favorite project centered around
                creating a kiosk for a coffee shop. When run, the program would allow
                the user to choose from black coffee, decaf, and tea. They could
                also add oat milk and a sugar syrup to their drink. When the user
                completed their order, the program calculated the total cost 
                with the MN Sales Tax included. I love coffee, so this was extra
                applicable to my life.

                <p>I am currently working on a project for the Mind Matters Club. We would
                like for St. Thomas to supply each student with a membership to the Headspace
                app. The app contains numerous meditations for all sorts of moods,
                days, times, and goals. I plan to gather research of the benefits of meditation
                for mental health and the app's success to present in front of certain St. Thomas
                faculty.
